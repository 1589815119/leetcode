# :pencil2: Leetcode Solutions with JavaScript

> Mar 31. 2016: I decide to add solutions **with simple descriptions** to each problem I have solved, to practise my writing English, as well as recording something.

If you **give this project a star**, I'll be quite thankful!

(Notes: :blue_book: means you need to buy a book from Leetcode)
